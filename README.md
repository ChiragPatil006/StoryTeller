## ‚ú® Key Features

This application focuses on three core, working functionalities to deliver a seamless analytical workflow:

### üìä Emotional Curve Visualization (EAI)

* Uses **Recharts** to generate a live, dynamic line graph mapping the **Emotional Appeal Index (EAI)** for every scene.
* Includes a **Curve Smoothing Filter (Moving Average)** to analyze overall story flow and calculate a quantitative **Pacing Score** to identify erratic emotional shifts.

### üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Scene Reordering (Drag & Drop)

* A robust and intuitive **Drag-and-Drop** interface allows users to instantly resequence scenes (story events).
* The EAI graph dynamically updates in real-time as the scenes are reordered, enabling rapid experimentation and "what-if" analysis.

### üìÑ Structured PDF Reporting

* An integrated **Export to PDF** feature generates a clean, structured, and print-friendly report.
* This ensures the current scene order, live graph visualization, and key metrics are perfectly preserved and easily shareable for pitching or feedback sessions.
